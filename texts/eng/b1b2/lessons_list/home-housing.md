## Основной текст / Main Text

Emma just moved into her first *apartment*, and she's absolutely thrilled about having her own place. The *apartment* has two *bedrooms*, a spacious *living room*, and a modern *kitchen* that she's really excited to cook in. The *bathroom* is small but functional, and she loves the big *windows* in the *living room* that let in lots of natural light.

When Emma first walked through the *door*, she was amazed by how much space there was. The *floors* are hardwood, which she really likes, and the *walls* are painted a nice neutral color. She's been spending a lot of time thinking about how to arrange her *furniture* to make the most of the space. She wants to put her *bed* in the *bedroom* facing the *window*, and she's planning to set up her *desk* in the corner of the *living room* where she can work from *home*.

Emma's been shopping for *furniture* and *home* decor items to make the *apartment* feel more like *home*. She found a beautiful *sofa* for the *living room* and a comfortable *chair* for reading. She also bought a new *table* for the *kitchen* and some *lamps* to create a cozy atmosphere. She's really looking forward to having friends over for dinner parties and movie nights.

The *apartment* building has a great community feel, and Emma has already met some of her neighbors. She loves that she can walk to work from her new *home*, and there are lots of shops and restaurants nearby. She's been thinking about getting a pet, maybe a cat, since the *apartment* allows pets and she has enough space for a small animal.
