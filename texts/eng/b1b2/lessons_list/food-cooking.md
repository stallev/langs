## Основной текст / Main Text

Maria loves *cooking* and experimenting with different types of *food* from around the world. She starts her day with a healthy *breakfast* that usually includes fresh *fruit*, whole grain *bread*, and a cup of *coffee*. For *lunch*, she often prepares a light *meal* with lots of *vegetables* and some lean *meat* or *fish*. She's really into trying new recipes and learning about different cuisines, especially Italian and Asian dishes.

Yesterday, Maria decided to *cook* a special *dinner* for her friends. She spent the afternoon preparing a delicious *pasta* dish with fresh *vegetables* and homemade sauce. She also made some garlic *bread* to go with the *meal*, and everyone loved it. For dessert, she served fresh *fruit* with a little bit of ice cream, which was the perfect ending to a great *dinner*.

Maria believes that good nutrition is really important for staying healthy, so she tries to eat a balanced diet with plenty of *vegetables*, *fruits*, and whole grains. She *drinks* lots of *water* throughout the day and limits her intake of sugary *drinks* like *juice* and soda. She also enjoys trying different types of *tea*, especially green *tea*, which she *drinks* in the evening to help her relax.

When Maria goes grocery shopping, she always looks for fresh, local ingredients. She prefers to *cook* her own *meals* rather than eating out all the time, *because* she can control *what* goes into her *food* and make sure it's healthy and delicious. She's always looking for new *cooking* techniques and recipes to try, and she loves sharing her culinary discoveries with her friends and family. She also enjoys *lunch* with colleagues and *dinner* parties where she can showcase her *cooking* skills.
