## Основной текст / Main Text

Last summer, my family and I decided to *travel* to Europe for our *vacation*, and it was absolutely amazing! We planned the *trip* for months, booking our *flight* *tickets* and finding a nice *hotel* in Paris. The *journey* was long but totally worth it. We had to pack our *luggage* carefully *because* we were going to be away for two weeks, and we didn't want to forget anything important.

When we arrived at the *airport*, everything went smoothly. The *flight* was comfortable, and we even got to watch some movies during the *trip*. After landing, we took a *taxi* to our *hotel*, which was located right in the center of the city. The *hotel* was beautiful and had an amazing view of the Eiffel Tower.

During our *holiday*, we used different types of transportation to get around the city. We took the *bus* to visit museums, *rode* the *train* to go to other cities, and sometimes *drove* a rental *car* when we wanted to explore the countryside. We also took a *ship* *trip* down the Seine River, which was one of the highlights of our *vacation*.

One day, we got lost in the city and had to use a *map* to find our way back to the *hotel*. It was actually kind of fun getting lost *because* we discovered some really cool places that we wouldn't have found otherwise. We met some friendly locals *who* helped us with directions, and we even learned a few French phrases along the way. We also used *tickets* for the metro and *passport* for international travel.
