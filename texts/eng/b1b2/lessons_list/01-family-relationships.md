## Основной текст / Main Text

Sarah comes from a big *family*, and honestly, it's been one of the best things in her life. Her *parents*, John and Mary, have been *married* for thirty years now, which is pretty amazing considering how common *divorce* has become these days. They've raised three kids together: Sarah, her older *brother* Michael, and her younger *sister* Emma. Sarah and Emma are super close - they're only two years apart, so they've always been like best friends.

Last summer was incredible. The whole *family* got together for Sarah's *cousin* Jennifer's *wedding*, and it was such a beautiful celebration. Everyone was there - *grandparents*, *aunts*, *uncles*, *cousins* from both sides. It was like a huge reunion! Sarah's *grandfather* gave this really touching speech about how *relationships* shape who we become. It made everyone tear up a bit.

Sarah's *parents* have always been big on *family* values. They believe that having strong *relationships* gives you support when times get tough, but also brings so much joy during the good times. A few years back, they went through a rough patch in their *marriage*, but they worked through it together and came out stronger. They always say that *love*, good communication, and *commitment* are what make a *marriage* work.

Now Sarah is thinking about starting her own *family* someday. She wants to find someone who values *family* as much as she does. Her dream is to create the same warm, loving home for her future *child* that her *parents* created for her and her siblings. She hopes to build the same kind of *bond* with her future *husband* and create a strong sense of *unity* in their home.

Sarah's *aunt* Lisa always *emphasizes* the importance of staying connected with *relatives*, even when life gets busy. Every year, they *gather* for a big family dinner where everyone shares stories and catches up. Sarah's *uncle* Tom and his *wife* have two kids - a *son* named Jake and a *daughter* named Lily. Sarah loves spending time with her little cousins and watching them grow up.
