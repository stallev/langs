## Основной текст / Main Text

David is a project manager who works with *number*s and *time* every day, and he's learned that being organized with schedules and deadlines is essential for success. He starts his week on *Monday* and usually has meetings scheduled for *Tuesday*, *Wednesday*, and *Thursday*, with *Friday* being his day to wrap up projects and plan for the next week. He's been working at his current company *since* *January*, and he's already completed *three* major projects.

Last month, David was working on a project that had a deadline *in* *March*, and he had to coordinate with *five* different teams. The project was supposed to take *six* weeks, but it actually took *eight* weeks to complete because of some unexpected challenges. David had to work late hours for *two* weeks straight, and he was exhausted by the *time* the project was finished.

David has learned that *time* management is crucial in his line of work. He always tries to arrive at meetings at least *five* minutes *before* they start, and he never schedules important meetings *on* *Friday* afternoons because people are usually tired and less focused. He's discovered that the *best* *time* to have productive meetings is *in* the morning, usually between *nine* and *eleven* o'clock.

What David finds most challenging about his job is dealing with different *time* zones when he's working with international clients. He has clients *in* *three* different countries, and he has to be careful about scheduling calls at appropriate *time*s for everyone. He's learned that it's *better* to schedule meetings *during* business hours *in* each *time* zone, even if it means working early *in* the morning or late *at* night. He also works with *zero* tolerance for missed deadlines and manages projects worth *million*s of dollars.
