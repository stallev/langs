## Основной текст / Main Text

Sarah loves *shopping*, especially when there's a good sale going on. Last weekend, she went to the *mall* with her friends to look for some new clothes. They spent hours browsing through different *stores*, trying on outfits and comparing *prices*. Sarah found a really cute dress at one of the boutiques, *but* it was a bit expensive, so she decided to think about it before *buying* it.

At the *supermarket*, Sarah always tries to *save* *money* by looking for deals and using coupons. She's really good at finding the best *prices* on groceries and household items. Yesterday, she went *shopping* for groceries and spent about fifty dollars on food for the week. She *paid* with her credit card *because* she didn't have enough *cash* with her.

Sarah has a savings *account* at the local *bank* *where* she puts *money* aside for big purchases. She's been *saving* up for a new laptop, and she's almost reached her goal. She also has a checking *account* that she uses for everyday expenses like *paying* bills and *buying* things online. She's really careful about *how* much *money* she *spends* and always tries to stay within her budget.

When Sarah goes *shopping* online, she always compares *prices* between different websites to make sure she's getting the best deal. She's learned that you can often find the same products for much cheaper *prices* if you *shop* around a bit. She also reads *customer* reviews before *buying* anything expensive to make sure it's worth the *cost*. She often visits the local *store* to see products in person before making online purchases.
